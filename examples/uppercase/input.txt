Tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the
kitchen even if it's salad pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box
but hiss at vacuum cleaner for lick human with sandpaper tongue. Ears back wide
eyed humans,humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center
of attention they feed, they clean . Jump launch to pounce upon little
yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed rub
butt on table poop on floor and watch human clean up sleep all day whilst slave
is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping. Refuse to leave cardboard
box chase red laser dot eat the rubberband haha you hold me hooman i scratch
for weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed. Jump off balcony, onto
stranger's head i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i
can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in
and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge
me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! cat slap dog in
face human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Murr
i hate humans they are so annoying vommit food and eat it again and scratch
the box. Sweet beast. I shall purr myself to sleep. Human clearly uses close
to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!
why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly,
stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout so kitty time
if it fits, i sits yet rub my belly hiss yet lick sellotape meow for food, then
when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing.

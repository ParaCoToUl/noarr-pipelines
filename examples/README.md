# Examples

This folder contains two examples that demonstrate the usage of this library:

- `uppercase`: A small, demonstrative example, showing the producer-consumer pattern. You should be able to understand this example after reading the [Core principles](docs/core-principles.md) section of the documentation.
- `kmeans`: A large example, implementing the k-means algorithm, using almost the entire library, with the cuda extension and with noarr structures.
